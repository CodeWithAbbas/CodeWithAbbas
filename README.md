- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CodeWithAbbas

I am a software engineer with a passion for embedded systems, specifically Microcontrollers and FPGAs. I am currently learning VHDL language using Vivado and eager to collaborate on FPGA algorithms. I believe that through collaboration, we can push the boundaries of what is possible with FPGA technology. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to reach me at 18jzele0237@uetpeshawar.edu.pk.
